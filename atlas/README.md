# role-os: how it works

Mapped at 2026-09-25 from commit 3877c03.

## What this is

15 parts, mostly JavaScript (162 files), Python (30) and TypeScript (2). Work enters through 4 doors; the busiest is CI, which reaches 3 parts. It publishes to npm. People run roleos.

## What changed since the last map

This is the first map.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request touching 13 paths; on a push touching 13 paths; or by hand. Runs bin/roleos.mjs and test/.
2. **Release.** When a release is published; or by hand. Runs test/.
3. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
4. **roleos** (a command people run). Runs bin/roleos.mjs.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs bin/roleos.mjs in bin and test/ in test.
2. That reaches src (70 files).
3. It writes to .claude/packets/.
4. It also writes to .claude/status/index.md, .role-os/specialist-events.jsonl, .role-os/specialist-field-log.jsonl and 1 more place, which are not tracked.

## Who reads the results

- **.claude/packets/** is read by src/packet.mjs and src/status.mjs.

## The other doors

**Release** runs test/, reaches src, writes to .claude/packets/ and to .claude/status/index.md, .role-os/specialist-events.jsonl, .role-os/specialist-field-log.jsonl and 1 more place, which are not tracked, and publishes to npm on a release event.

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, and deploys the site.

**roleos** (a command people run) runs bin/roleos.mjs, reaches src, and writes to .claude/packets/ and to .claude/status/index.md, .role-os/specialist-events.jsonl, .role-os/specialist-field-log.jsonl and 1 more place, which are not tracked.

## What breaks what

- **src** is imported by 4 parts (.claude, bin, dossier, tools), and by 1 more only from tests; it sits on the path of 3 doors.
- **bin** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.
- **test** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.
- **.claude/packets/** is written by src and read by src; a hand edit reaches every reader.
- **dossier/aptitude-tuned.json** is written by dossier and read by dossier; a hand edit reaches every reader.

## What tends to change together

- **src/specialist/training-programs.mjs** and **test/specialist-training-programs.test.mjs** changed together in 5 of 6 commits, and the test part imports the src part.
- **src/mission-run.mjs** and **src/mission.mjs** changed together in 6 of 8 commits, inside the src part.
- **src/specialist/record.mjs** and **test/specialist-record.test.mjs** changed together in 5 of 9 commits, and the test part imports the src part.

2 files changed together with their own tests, as expected.

Confidence is low: fewer than 20 source files reach 10 revisions in the window.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since 3 source files reach 10 revisions; the floor rises to 10 when 25 do.

## What no test touches

- **dossier** is imported by no test.
- **tools** is imported by no test.

bin is touched by tests only through a spawn: a test runs its files as a child process.

## Written but never read

- **dossier/data.js** is written by dossier/build-gallery.mjs and read by nothing else in this repository.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

- **.claude/packets/** is written by src/fs-utils.mjs.
- **.claude/role-os/tool-contracts.json** is written by tools/conformance-dataset/live-tools/build_live_contracts.mjs.
- **dossier/aptitude-tuned.json** is written by dossier/apply-tuning-fixes.mjs and dossier/tune-aptitudes.mjs.
- **dossier/data.js** is written by dossier/build-gallery.mjs.
- **dossier/portraits/briefs/** is written by dossier/portraits/write-prompt.mjs.
- **dossier/portraits/web/** is written by dossier/optimize-portraits.py.
- **tools/conformance-dataset/** is written by tools/conformance-dataset/build_conformance_dataset.py and tools/conformance-dataset/build_tool_constraints.mjs.
- **tools/conformance-dataset/corpus_l4.json** is written by tools/conformance-dataset/author_l4.py.
- **tools/conformance-dataset/corpus_tools.json** has a block written by tools/conformance-dataset/merge_corpus.py.
- **tools/conformance-dataset/live-tools/corpus.json** is written by tools/conformance-dataset/live-tools/prep_inputs.mjs.
- **tools/conformance-dataset/live-tools/raw.json** is written by tools/conformance-dataset/live-tools/prep_inputs.mjs.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, .role-os/, assets/, design/, examples/, the repository root, site/, specs/ and starter-pack/; 19 writes with paths built at run time may land here.

## Where to start

.github/workflows/ci.yml → bin/roleos.mjs → src/artifacts-cmd.mjs

Read those in order to follow one pull request end to end.

## What this map cannot see

- 15 import sites could not be resolved.
- 19 writes and 16 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 7 writes go to places this repository does not track, so they are not listed as generated.
- 13 writes and 67 reads go to the directory the command is run in, not to this repository.
- 35 writes and 34 reads go to a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 23 writes and 23 reads go to the directory the command is run in or a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 7 writes and 1 read go to a temporary directory, not to this repository.
- 10 commands are built at run time and not followed, 2 of them in tests.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 20 source files reach 10 revisions in the window.
